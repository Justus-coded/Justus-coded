### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome!!! You found my page. I am a graduate student at Auburn University, Alabama, in the Department of Biosystems Engineering. My current research revolves around using precision agriculture techniques with data to solve problems in the agricultural sector. Beyond my research, I love using data to solve problems, and this extends to any field. I have experience working in the Energy, Finance, and Agricultural sectors.

Want to collaborate? Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently exploring LLMs and their applications.  
- ðŸŒ± Computer Vision and its applications.
- ðŸ‘¯ Explainable AI
- âš¡ Feel free to contact me on any exciting project outside these areas.
